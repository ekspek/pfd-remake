# Primary Flight Display Rework

A port/remake of our SAI final project in the Lua-based LÖVE framework. For more information on the original project, visit the [original repo page](https://github.com/ekspek/sai-2018/tree/master/project).

### Usage

To run the program on Linux, make sure you have LÖVE 11.0 or higher installed. Download the repo, navigate to the root folder and run
```
love ./
```
Instead of relying on input from external programs, like the original program, this version currently relies on keyboard inputs for testing. The mappings are found below.
| Variable  | Increase Key | Decrease key |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Pitch  | Up key | Down key |
| Roll  | Right key | Left key |
| Airspeed  | Z | X |
| Altitude  | A | S |
| Heading  | W | Q |
| Vertical speed  | 1 | 2 |
Networking capabilites similar to the original project are planned but not yet implemented.

#### Font

The font used was the [B612 font family](https://b612-font.com/), available [on GitHub](https://github.com/polarsys/b612). Copyright goes to the font creators.
